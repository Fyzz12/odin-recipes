Assingment 1

making a simple HTML recipe website


left assingment and returned weeks later. Had issues pushing files to github through command line so did it manually.
deleted ramen and coffee files as i uploaded them to the wrong spot. Had issues fixing as i was trying to put these files in the index FILE (not folder) instead of recipes folder
i may have not been in my github repository <<< look into
